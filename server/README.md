## Requirements

Before you can run the server, ensure that your machine meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Dependencies

The server relies on various Node.js packages. You can install them using npm. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm init -y
The following dependencies will be installed:

express: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
body-parser: Middleware to parse JSON requests.
jsonwebtoken: For JSON Web Token (JWT) generation and validation.
mariadb: MariaDB/MySQL driver for Node.js.
dotenv: Load environment variables from a .env file.
joi: Schema validation library (if used for data validation).

Configuration
Before running the server, configure your environment variables in a .env file. Create a .env file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

DB_HOST=<database-host>
DB_USER=<database-username>
DB_PASSWORD=<database-password>
DB_DATABASE=<database-name>
PORT=<server-port>

Replace the placeholders with your actual database and server configuration:

<database-host>: The host address of your MariaDB or MySQL database.
<database-username>: The username for the database.
<database-password>: The password for the database user.
<database-name>: The name of the database.
<server-port>: The port on which the server will run.

Note: Keep your .env file secure and do not commit it to version control.

Installation

Start the Node.js server by running the following command:

node --watch server.js

The server will start and be accessible at http://localhost:<server-port>.

Routes
The server provides the following routes:

/register: Register a new user.
/login: Authenticate and generate a JWT token.
/protected-resource: Access a protected resource by including the JWT token in the request headers.
