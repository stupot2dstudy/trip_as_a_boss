# My Node.js Server

This Node.js server is a simple example of how to build and run a web application using Express.js. It includes features such as user registration, login, protected routes, and file uploads.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the server on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): npm is included with Node.js.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
   git clone git@github.com:stupot2dstudy/trip_as_a_boss.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
   cd server
   ```
3. Install the project dependencies:
```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration
    Before running the server, you'll need to configure your environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and set the following environment variables:

PORT=3000           # Port for the server to listen on
DB_HOST=localhost   # Database host
DB_USER=root        # Database username
DB_PASSWORD=password # Database password
DB_DATABASE=mydb    # Database name
SECRET_KEY=mysecret # Secret key for JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication

## Running the Server
    To start the server, run the following command:
```bash
   npm install
   ```
The server will be running at http://localhost:3000.

Features
User Registration
Endpoint: /register
Description: Allows users to create new accounts by providing a username, password, first name, last name, and email. User data is stored in a MySQL database.
User Login
Endpoint: /login
Description: Allows registered users to log in with their username and password. Successful login generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication.
Protected Routes
Description: Certain routes are protected and require user authentication. Users must include a valid JWT in the request headers to access these routes.
File Upload
Endpoint: /upload
Description: Allows users to upload files. Uploaded files are stored in the ./public/fileUpload directory.
